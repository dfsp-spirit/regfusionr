# regfusionr
R implementation of registration fusion method for MNI152 - 305 mapping.

This is an R implementation of [Wu et al (2018)'s registration fusion methods](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hbm.24213) to project MRI data from standard volumetric coordinates, either MNI152 or Colin27, to Freesurfer's fsaverage.

This R implementation is heavily inspired by Dan Gale's Python implementation in the [regfusion](https://github.com/danjgale/reg-fusion) package.

A huge thank you to Dan Gale and  *Wu et al* for making their excellent tools openly available! If you use this package, **please cite the original**:
